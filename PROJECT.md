Astro Vision: The Agentic DeSci X DAO on BSC - community voting for as low as 0.01$ BNB

01 — Problem

Space science has a gate keeping problem. Millions observe the sky every night. They see things. They wonder. And then — nothing. No tool to analyse what they saw, no permanent record that they saw it first, no way for their voice to shape what the scientific community explores next.

 AI Tools Are Locked Away
Professional-grade astronomical image analysis requires institutional access or deep ML expertise. No tool exists that lets an amateur upload a photo and get a real scientific interpretation — until now.
- 🗂️ Discoveries Have No Permanent Home
Amateur findings scatter across Reddit, Discord, Twitter. They vanish. There is no tamper-proof, timestamped, globally verifiable record of who discovered what and when.
- 🏛️Governance Is Centralised
What the community researches and funds is decided by committees behind closed doors. The 1.5 million amateur observers worldwide have zero formal voice in the direction of citizen science.
- 🤖 AI Doesn't Speak Astronomy
General models hallucinate when asked about celestial objects. They lack domain-specific training on astrophysics literature, coordinate systems, and the precise vocabulary of space science.
- 🌍The Global Access Gap
Over 3 billion people lack access to quality scientific education. Paywalled research, English-only content, and geography determine who gets to learn  not curiosity, not merit.
- 💀 No Accountability Layer
Research findings are manipulated, retracted, or buried with no public record. Trust in science is eroding because there is no transparent, immutable ledger of what was discovered, voted on, or debated.

03 — How We Solve It

Upload. Discover. Govern. Repeat.
We collapse the distance between pointing a telescope at the sky and actually contributing to science — pairing multimodal AI with on-chain identity and community governance.
- Upload → Instant Expert Analysis
Any user uploads an astronomical image. Our pipeline runs it through Kimi K2.5 for object identification, then AstroSage-8B (domain-trained on astrophysics literature) for scientific interpretation, then cross-references NASA's historical archive for context. Professional-grade analysis in seconds, for anyone, anywhere.
- Contribute → Earn On-Chain Reputation
Every vote cast, proposal created, and discovery submitted earns the user non-transferable on-chain reputation stored in our BNB mainnet smart contract. Permanent, tamper-proof, publicly verifiable. The beginning of a decentralised scientific CV that no institution can revoke or ignore.
- Vote → Shape Research Direction
Through AstroDAO, the community proposes and votes on weekly research themes, validates discoveries, and directs grants. Every proposal lives on-chain. Every vote is transparent. Execution is automated by smart contract with a 2-day timelock — governance that cannot be captured by any single actor.
- Explore → Live Space Simulation
A Three.js particle laboratory lets users visualise the objects they've discovered — galaxy formations, Saturn's rings, supernovae — with hand-tracking via webcam as a physical control interface. AI analysis connects directly to real-time visual models, bridging data and intuition.




04 — The Product We Built

Six modules. One living platform.
A production-deployed full-stack React + Node.js application every module tightly integrated through shared state, a central WalletContext, and unified authentication.
Core Intelligence 🔭 Observation Lab
The heart of the platform. Users upload any astronomical image and receive layered analysis: Kimi k2.5  identifies the object visually, AstroSage-8B provides domain-expert scientific commentary, and the NASA archive supplies historical comparison. Pure text queries supported via AstroSage chat.
- 🗳️AstroDAO
On-chain governance with 5 proposal types, reputation-weighted voting, liquid delegation, 2-day timelocked execution, and pausable emergency mechanism. Deployed to BNB mainnet.
- 🌌Space Lab
Real-time Three.js particle simulation with galaxy, Saturn ring, supernova, and custom shapes. WebGL hand-tracking via webcam as physical control interface.
- 👥 Community Board
Discovery sharing with nested threaded comments, reactions, image uploads, and user profiles linked to on-chain identity. Community discussion grounded in verifiable reputation.
- 🎨AI Playground
A generative canvas where users text-morph particle systems and load custom images into real-time AI-driven visual transformations.
- 🔑Universal Auth
EIP-6963 wallet discovery — MetaMask, Coinbase, Brave, Rabby — plus Twitter OAuth and Guest mode. Central WalletContext shared across all modules with zero redundancy.




05 — Innovation on BNB Chain

Why BNB Chain makes this possible and permanent.
The blockchain layer is not decorative. BNB Chain's economics enable governance interactions that would be prohibitively expensive elsewhere — making mass community participation in science real, not theoretical.
- 🔶 AstroDAO — Built From the Ground Up for Science Governance
Reputation as Scientific Identity
Every vote, proposal, and execution earns non-transferable on-chain reputation capped at 10,000, immutably stored, publicly verifiable. Your scientific credibility is permanently yours. It cannot be bought, sold, or revoked by any institution.
- Five Proposal Types for Science
Weekly Theme, Research Discovery, Community Proposal, Knowledge Sharing, Collaboration — each with configurable voting periods (3-day quick or 7-day standard) so governance pace matches topic urgency.
- Security Without Compromise
Reentrancy Guard blocks re-entry attacks. Pausable allows emergency halt. 2-day execution timelock prevents rushed changes. Quorum requirements prevent low-participation governance capture. Battle-tested OpenZeppelin base.
- Liquid Delegation
Users delegate voting power to trusted researchers or community leaders, enabling democratic science governance where domain experts carry weighted influence — revocable at any time.
IPFS-Anchored Discovery Records
- Supporting research documents stored on IPFS with hashes committed on-chain. A permanent, censorship-resistant archive of community discoveries that persists regardless of any platform or organisation.
Sub-Cent Economics at Scale
BNB Chain fees make micro-interactions viable for a global community across every income level. Voting costs pennies. Earning reputation costs pennies. Science governance should not be a privilege of the wealthy.





06 — Core Impact

What changes when Astro-Vision exists.
This is not a product that improves an existing workflow. It creates a new category: community-governed, AI-powered citizen science — where the line between amateur observer and scientific contributor disappears.
- 🌍Democratised Discovery
A teenager in Lagos with a secondhand telescope gets the same AI analysis as an MIT astronomer. Geography and institution stop determining access to scientific tools.
- 📜Permanent Attribution
Discoveries are timestamped on-chain forever. Community members build verifiable, uncensorable scientific records no forum shutdown or platform can erase.
- 🧬Community-Driven Science
Research priorities chosen by 10,000 passionate observers beat those set by 10 committee members. Collective intelligence reshapes what gets studied.
- 🤝Web2 and Web3, Unified
Twitter OAuth and Guest mode mean anyone can start today. Blockchain is opt-in — lowering the bar while preserving decentralised ownership for those who want it.
- 🧠Domain AI, Not Generic AI
AstroSage-8B is trained on astrophysics literature. It reasons in the specific language of space science — not generic, not hallucinated.
- 🚀Education Through Participation
Every interaction is a learning moment. AstroVision turns passive sky-watchers into educated contributors to real, verifiable
